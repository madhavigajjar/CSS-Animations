# CSS-Animations

The project is intended to help the students of science background to get basic knowledge on topics related to Semiconductors. The project is done by a team of two members working a same module and it followed agile scrum methodology. The PN junction, types of semiconductors, half wave rectifier and introduction to Zener diode are the topics covered by the animations. HTML CSS is used in creating the animations. The SVG images can be created in Adobe Illustrator and animated using CSS Animations. The animations contain definition, examples and figures to make the concepts clear.

The PN junction is formed when the p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined and this is shown in the animation as transfer of electrons. For the half-wave rectifier, the construction and working of the circuit are shown. The types of Semiconductors (intrinsic and extrinsic) are shown by giving examples like Gallium Arsenide. The Zener diode is explained in short that is it contains the components used for building the circuit and the construction. Also the I-V curve is explained in short.

The small animations are combined and a full topic is covered. Audio can be added to the videos to make the student learn efficiently which is a part of the future scope.
